This is a simple parsing library for simple configuration. It parses no types
nor hierarchy, so you'll have to do that stuff yourself. All that exist are
key-value pairs which are iterated through sequentially.

Details of the API can be found in scone.h. I've tried to keep the API quite
simple.

To build/run the tests, use the run-tests shell script.
